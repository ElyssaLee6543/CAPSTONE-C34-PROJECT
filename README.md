# CAPSTONE-C34-PROJECT (Billy's Bouncy Ball)
Billy was playing with a bouncy ball, when he knocked over a vase! He wanted a way to play with a bouncy ball, without breaking anything. He developed a game where he could bounce his ball! However, there is no top barrier, so the challenge is to bounce it inside of the screen! All he needs to do is click the "PUSH" button to bounce the ball!
